CS 455 Final Project


How to use:

`python3 getdata.py`

This command downloads data from the quickdraw dataset into the data folder.
After that, each data/class subdirectory includes all the images of the specific class.

`python3 network1.py`

This command will train on the neural network (currently the network only does a linear mapping)
